A Test framework and some emulated sensors.

The build target test-emulator will build a executable that can connect to the server and run tests against the UI.
Emulated sensors are added to the server topology of connected sensors. The backend is called "emulator".
Emulated sensors are build as part of the "libsensact.so" currently.
To run the emulator set the library path as: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.

If the tests are not run the emulated engine will react on UI input for example the Motor speed control.
If the tests are run with ./emulator the framework will start executing a series of test.

The emulated sensors are manipulated via shared memory and the not set and get functions for the sensors them self.
The shared memory is setup as the initial part of the test suite. If this fails for some reason you will see the 
"setup failed!" message in the terminal.

The following is a example configuration of the sensact server, found in sensact.c on the server.
The backend named "emulator" is already registered. This will create the three sensors. 


static  emulator_config_t emulator_senshub_config = {
       .name = emulator_senshub,
    };

    static  emulator_config_t emulator_engine_config = {
        .name = emulator_engine,
    };

    static  emulator_config_t emulator_ble_config = {
    	.name = emulator_bluetooth_lowenergy_device,
     };



    static struct sa_device_t devices[] = {
        {   .name = "nfc0",
            .description = "TI Tiva Launchpad device (with NFC)",
            .backend = "usb",
            .config = &usb_nfc0_config },

        {   .name = "motor0",
            .description = "TI Tiva Launchpad device (with motor)",
            .backend = "emulator",
            .config = &emulator_engine_config },

        {   .name = "sensortag0",
            .description = "BLE Device",
            .backend = "emulator",
            .config = &emulator_ble_config },

        {  .name = "senshub0",
            .description = "TI Tiva Launchpad device (with Sensehub)",
            .backend = "emulator",
            .config = &emulator_senshub_config },

        { }
    };
